Cultural Practices:
Rotate crops to break the disease cycle.
Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip irrigation if possible.
Provide adequate spacing between plants for good air circulation.
Chemical Control:
Fungicides can be used as a preventive measure or as a curative treatment when the disease is detected early. Copper-based fungicides or fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb are commonly used.
Resistant Varieties: Some potato varieties are more resistant to early blight than others. Choosing resistant varieties can help reduce the impact of the disease.
Organic Control:
Organic fungicides containing neem oil, potassium bicarbonate, or copper can be used.
Applying compost and other organic amendments can improve soil health and plant resistance.

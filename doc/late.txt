Cultural Practices:
Rotate crops annually to prevent the buildup of the pathogen in the soil.
Remove and destroy infected plant material to reduce the spread of spores.
Provide adequate spacing between plants for better air circulation.
Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to keep foliage dry.
Chemical Control:
Fungicides can be used to manage late blight, especially during periods of high disease pressure. Effective fungicides include those containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper compounds.
Apply fungicides preventively, following the recommended application intervals and rates.
Resistant Varieties:
Planting potato varieties that are resistant to late blight can help reduce disease severity. Some varieties have genetic resistance to certain strains of Phytophthora infestans.
Organic Control:
Organic fungicides, such as copper-based products, can help manage late blight.
Biological control agents, like beneficial microbes, can also be used to suppress the disease.
